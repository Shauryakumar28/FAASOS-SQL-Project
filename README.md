# FAASOS Delivery Insights: A Deep Dive with SQL
This project delves into the world of FAASOS deliveries using SQL to extract valuable insights that can optimize operations, enhance customer experience, and potentially improve profitability.

# Data Preparation:
A pre-designed database containing FAASOS delivery data served as the foundation for this project. The data underwent rigorous cleaning and processing to ensure accuracy and facilitate effective analysis.

# Unveiling Key Metrics:
By leveraging SQL queries, we were able to answer critical questions about various aspects of FAASOS deliveries:

# 1.Driver Performance:
Delivery Success Rate: We calculated the percentage of successful deliveries completed by each driver, identifying areas for improvement.<br>
Delivery Efficiency: We analyzed the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times, as well as the average speed for each driver, revealing potential variations in efficiency.<br>
Pick-Up Time: We determined the average time each driver took to reach FAASOS HQ for order pick-up, pinpointing potential bottlenecks.<br>
# 2.Customer Experience:
Delivery Time vs. Order Size: We investigated the relationship between the number of rolls ordered and order preparation time, potentially informing menu optimization strategies.<br>
Distance Traveled: We analyzed the average distance traveled for each customer, potentially helping with delivery fee structures.<br>
# 3.Inventory, Pricing and Ratings:
Order Cancellations: We identified the number of rolls delivered with both exclusions and extras, highlighting potential communication gaps between customers and the platform.<br>
Order Size Analysis: We revealed the maximum number of rolls ordered in a single order, providing insights into customer preferences and potential bulk order options.<br>
Roll Popularity: We identified the number of each type of roll delivered, informing inventory management and menu adjustments.<br>
Vegetarian vs. Non-Vegetarian: We calculated the number of veg and non-veg rolls ordered by each customer, potentially aiding targeted marketing campaigns.<br>
Overall Order Volume: We determined the total number of rolls ordered and the number of unique customer orders placed, providing a comprehensive overview of FAASOS delivery activity.<br>


This project demonstrates the power of SQL in unlocking valuable insights from FAASOS delivery data. By leveraging these insights, FAASOS can enhance operational efficiency, elevate customer satisfaction, and potentially achieve greater profitability.
